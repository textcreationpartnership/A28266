            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29834:3"/> with Rods and Scourges, his Heart with Spears and Launces; in a word, you struck him all over, and never left striking till you struck him dead upon a <hi>Cross.

Is not he the Only Son of all your tender Loves? and the eternal Object of all your inflam'd Affections? Why then, O why do you strike him? and strike him with such severity as shakes the whole Frame of Nature, and sets all Heaven and Earth a trembling: <hi>Quid enim mali fecit?</hi>

               <p>HA! no doubt, no doubt, but the disorder of <hi>Sin</hi> is a strange disorder, seeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ever satisfie for this disorder but the Sufferings of <hi>a GOD:</hi> the stain of <hi>Sin</hi> must needs be very foul, and of the blackest dye, which nothing could wash away but the blood of the <hi>Spotless Lamb:</hi> and the evil of <hi>Sin</hi> must needs be greatest of all evils, which nothing could repair but the death of <hi>Life it self.</hi> But when, or where did the Son of God begin to satisfie for this Disorder? blot out this stain? and repair this evil? Ha! <hi>Christians,</hi> 'twas in the <hi>Garden of Olives,</hi> 'twas in his own hands, even the hands of <hi>Love,</hi> that he may truly, say <hi>propter scelus populi mei, percussi me, I struck my self for the sins of my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet to see a <hi>Jesus</hi> in his own hands, has nothing in it sure that's rogorous; at least, according to all appearance it should be so; for as he knows his own <hi>Purity,</hi> his own <hi>Sanctity,</hi> his own <hi>Innconcency</hi> better than all Men and Angels besides, so doubtless he'l be kind to himself, he'l spare himself without all <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> Ha! no, no, (dear <hi>Christians</hi>) would you believe it, and Love of <hi>Jesus</hi> strikes the first blow upon the heart of <hi>Jesus,</hi> that I may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29834:5"/> truly say, <hi>Jesus</hi> is become his own first Judge, and his own first Executioner: <hi>propter scelus populi mei percussi me.</hi> In effect, methinks I contemplate the boundless Love of his Heart, like an invisible Priest leading this Innocent Victim into <hi>Garden of Olives,</hi> as into a Holy Temple, the fittest place for such a Sacrifice; and he makes choice of the night, because then all Nature being clad in mourning, or buried as it were under the dark shades of solitude and silencie, Love had more power to act upon his tender <hi>Heart</hi> &amp; fill his afflicted <hi>Soul</hi> with such bitter Floods of sorrow as forc't him to groan forth this sad complaint, <hi>My Soul is sorrowful even to death: Tristis est anima mea usque ad mortem. Math.</hi> 24.30. But here to go on in order, let us with pensive hearts contemplate the <hi>Prayers,</hi> the <hi>Tears,</hi> and the <hi>Bloody Sweat</hi> of our Agonizing Redeemer: or here let us see if Tears will give us leave to see How <hi>Jesus</hi>

This Prayer then was only to signifie the conditional desires and imperfect wishes of the inferior part of his Soul; as if he would say, Ha! sinful Souls, for whose dear sake I suffer, <hi>videte affictionem meam: (Thren</hi> 1.) I leave you your selves to judge how; bitter, how severe, how sharp my sorrows are, since though I know, 'tis the Decree, the Will, and the Pleasure of my Father, though I my self am resolv'd <hi>to lay down my life for my Flock,</hi> and imbrace my Cross with open Arms, yet I seek for a Dispensation, and am forc't to cry, Father, if it can be done, let this Cup pass from me; <hi>Pater, si fieri potest, transeat oa me calix iste.</hi> Thus we have heard him Pray, now let us see him Weep for the Sins of the People, <hi>propter scelus populi mei,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Ha! 'tis here, <hi>'tis here,</hi> if ever I may truly say, <hi>thou art Spouse of Blood to me, (Exod.</hi> 4.) because here thou hast espous'd me to thy self, and sign'd this happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between us with those purple streams of thy own most precious Blood which flow from all the parts and pores of thy Sacred Body, to wash away <hi>the sins of thy People.</hi>

               <p>But here I am seiz'd with admiration, and lost in wonder; <hi>for</hi> to see my loving Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bleed upon the <hi>Altar</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> in the Mistery of his <hi>Circumcision,</hi> was no great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for there stands a Priest with a sharp Knife in his hand, ready to cut him and make him bleed; nor was it any wonder to see him bleed upon the <hi>High Altar</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> for here I find whole crouds of bloody Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors arm'd with Thorns and Nails, and Rods and Scourges, and Spears and Launces, ready to wound him from head to foot, and make him bleed all over: but to find him bleeding upon this <hi>little Mount of Olives,</hi> and bleeding all alone, that's the Wonder of Wonders: and yet this bleeding body of a Jesus does accuse some one or other to have given the fatal blow: but who? was it <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, James,</hi> or <hi>John?</hi> Ha! no, no, <hi>for</hi> they were fast asleep, <hi>invenit eos dormientes, erant enim oculi eorum gravati,</hi> Mat. 26.43. Besides, they lov'd their Master too well to wound
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29834:9"/> him; and yet when all's done, I say this Body could not bleed without hands; ha! 'tis true, <hi>Christians, 'tis true,</hi> and if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I told you at the very beginning of this Discourse, by what hand he bleeds; 'tis by his own hand, even the Hand of Love; Love's the Launce that opens all his Veins, and makes him bleed in showers <hi>for the sins of his People.</hi>

               <p>No question, but the Incarnate Son of God had always the Cross in view, even from the first instant of his <hi>life,</hi> he knew what he came for, he knew what he was to do, and what he was to suffer, <hi>ipse enim sciebat quid esset fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturus, atque passurus:</hi> And yet 'tis <hi>credible,</hi> these apprehensions of his Cross were not then so violent, or so afflicting, because his death appear'd at a greater distance; besides, he foresaw all those noble imploys he was to undertake for the Glory of his Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all those conspicuous Miracles he was to work in the World, to prove the power of his Divinity; and perhaps, these illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ideas of what he was to do, might in some measure, sweeten the bitter reflections of what he was to suffer. But alas! alas! knowing this very night to be the last of his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29834:10"/> Life, and that his dolorous Passion was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin within two or three hours, then, <hi>O then,</hi> his Love redoubling all his natural Fears, took all other Objects from his fight, and left him none but that of his approaching Death. O my suffering <hi>Jesus,</hi> I see, I see your Love is like to cost you dear! O how rigorous are those Laws your Justice has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted against your self? When a guilty Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal is condem'd to die, they usually hide from his sightall those Instruments of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice which are to bereave him of his Life; 'tis enough he falls once a Victim to the Law, 'tis enough he dies once, without causing him to die over and over again by frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of his pains; but these Laws of Common Humanity, which favour the very worst of Men, wre not made, it seems, for this Holy Innocent. Ha! no, no, for the first, <hi>if not the greatest</hi> of all his Suffering, is to see them all at leisure; and if you ask me why? answer, 'twas to content the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Love of his Heart, by suffering twice for us 1. <hi>Really,</hi> and 2. by <hi>Reflection: Really</hi> on the day of his <hi>Passion</hi> upon the <hi>Mount df Calvary;</hi> and by <hi>Reflection,</hi> on the night (as I may call it) of his Sorrow upon this <hi>Mount
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29834:10"/> of Olives.</hi> Imn fine, many doubtless were the Motives, the Reasons, or the Causes of this thrice repeated Prayer, these Floods of Tears, this bloody Sweat, this inward Grief, this in teriour Agony of <hi>Jesus,</hi> as the dolours of his blessed Mother, the Treachery of <hi>Judas,</hi> the Denyal of <hi>Peter,</hi> the shameful flight of his Disciples, and the like. But I wave all this, to insist upon the last and the greatest Cause of all, the everlasting Ruine and Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so many Thousand Souls, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all these bitter things he has done and suffer'd <hi>for the Sins of the People.</hi>

               <p>But what need of Angels to comfort the Lord of Angels? since 'tis in the power of Men to perforth this Duty better than all the Angels of God together; and the case is dear for the only comfort he requires, is to see his Passion efficacious, and the Angels cannot make it so because he died not for them, but for us: from us then, and from us alone he experts this consolation, as the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29834:12"/> first return of our grateful hearts, for these first drops of his Blood shed by the hands of his Love. Ha! Dear <hi>Christians,</hi> there are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates enough in the World, who trample the Blood of this Lamb under foot; there are damn'd enough in Hell to render his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion fruitless; but we, for our parts, before we stir a foot out of this Holy Ground, this Garden of Sorrow, let us resolve to render his Sufferings efficacious by a timely Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and a speedy conversion to our God; and since <hi>Jesus</hi> strikes his own tender heart with the hands of Love, till he opens all the veins and pores of his blessed Body to pour forth tears of blood for our Iniquities: ha! let us strike these <hi>more than stony hearts</hi> of ours with the hands of a holy indignation against our selves, and never leave striking, till we open every vein within, and every pore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, to weep whole stoods of repentant tears, which being mixt with the and the sweat, and the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lamb, may serve as a <hi>precious Laver</hi> to cleanse our polluted <hi>Souls</hi> from all the sordid <hi>Spots</hi> and <hi>Stains</hi> of Sin.

               <p>O what a shameful confusion then! what a strange hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation for this Holy of Holies to stand before these wicked Judges, and present himself at their Tribunals! But Heavens! what have Men to do to judge a God? How comes his Cause to fall under their Examination? By what Law are they become his Judges? Besides they are his sworn Enemies, corrupted by their own Passions, and blinded with pannick Fears: St. <hi>Chrysistom</hi> assures us, this <hi>Court</hi> was an Assembly to Thieves, who were resolv'd t rob the World's <hi>Messias</hi> of his Life and HOnour both at once, <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas</hi> were impious, <hi>Herod</hi> a Tyrant, <hi>Pilate</hi> an Idolator, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> meer Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; and yet <hi>Jesus,</hi> the Only Begotten Son of the Living God, <hi>Jesus</hi> the Lamb without Spot, <hi>Jesus</hi> the Innocent, stands before these Judges bare-headed, a Rope about his Neck, his hands bound behind him, and patiently expects, like an apparetn Criminal, to receive the Sentence of his Death. O Soveraign Lord of all Heaven and Earth, O thou just Judge of the Living and the Dead, 'tis here, <hi>'tis here,</hi> if ever thou hast, not only humbled, but even anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated thy Honour, and stript thy self of Glory, for lower

Was that a fault? Was it to have <hi>Cleans'd</hi> the <hi>Leper,</hi> and <hi>Rais'd</hi> the Dead? Was that a Crime? Or was it, in fine, because he call'd himself a God? and a Son of the <hi>Highest?</hi> Ha! was he not so? Yes, yes, his unheard of silence, his unpalallel'd Patience in the midst of so many Injuries, so many Calumnies, so many Clamorous, Outcries, and falfe Depositions of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Witnesses, more than sufficiently declare his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and his Innocency both at once: for, as the Learned <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> observes excellently well, he must needs be a God, who be thus accus'd, and thus abus'd, had nothing in him of the Troubles, the Disquiets, or the Impatience of Man; <hi>nihil de impatientia hominis imitatus est.</hi>

                  <hi>Pilate</hi> himself admires his Silence (<hi>Mat.</hi> 27.14.) and is so charm'd with the lustre of his Virtues, that he Proclaims him Innocent, and of his Judge becomes his Advocate, <hi>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil inventio causae in hoc homine;</hi> Luke 23. V. 4. Well then, <hi>Pilate, well,</hi> and shall a wicked piece of Policy, a base compliance for humane respects, a servile fear to loose the amity of <hi>Caesar,</hi> force thee, at last to pronounce an unjust Sentence against this spotless Innocent? Yes, this was the loss of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and this is the loss of many, who to please
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29834:16"/> the Princes and <hi>Great Ones</hi> of the World, break the just Laws of God, and spurn at the Commands of their Heavenly Soveraign.</p>
               <p>But alas! alas! here again, whil'st I am speaking, my <hi>Jesus</hi> is still dishonoured more and more, a <hi>Thief,</hi> a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,</hi> a <hi>Seditious Man,</hi> a <hi>profligated Villain</hi> is prefer'd in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction before the <hi>Lord of Glory.</hi> Methinks, in all reason, they ought rather to have chosen one that gave Life to the Dead, than one that took away the Lives of the Living. But what remedy? the <hi>Scribes</hi> and the <hi>Charisees</hi> will have it so, they inflame the multitude, and stir up the people to choose <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabas,</hi> and refuse, <hi>Jesus, non hunc, sed Barrabam,</hi> John 18.40. O unhappy choice, and most injurious to the Honour of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> unless, perhaps the Sinner makes a worse, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his own will and pleasure, before the Will and Pleasure of his God; for he renounces <hi>Jesus,</hi> not bound in Cords and Chains, not <hi>J sus,</hi> standing like a Criminal at the Bar, but <hi>Jesus</hi> in the Kingdom of his Glory, <hi>Jesus</hi> standing at the Right Hand of his Eternal Father: Ha! how often does the wicked Man say in his heart, <hi>non hunc, sed Barrabam:</hi> away with a God, the World is my God, die <hi>Jesus,</hi> live Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, take who will the Creator, give me the Creature, <hi>non hunc sed Barrabam.</hi> But now let's return to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and see at last how he resolves to dispose of this holy Innocent; for I see he would fain save his Life, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Silence then, <hi>silence</hi> in the Court, for the Judge is now ready to give sentence, but a sentence the most barbarous, the most inhumane, and the most unjust that ever yet was heard of; hear it then, <hi>Christians,</hi> and even tremble when
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29834:17"/> you hear it; for the very first clause of the Sentence imports that <hi>Jesus</hi> must be Scourg'd. But hold, <hi>Pilate,</hi> hold, before this bloody Sentence pass any further, I appeal; and since my loving Saviour has no other Advocate but his own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and is resolv'd to smother his own Cause in silence, I'll plead in his behalf: <hi>Pilate,</hi> thouglh you design by this means to set your Prisoner free, and save his Life, yet you shed his blood unjustly; for, must an Innocent be scourg'd, to satisfie the rage of his cruel Enemies? Besides, you know this Penalty is inflicted by the Law upon <hi>Thieves, Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Traytors, Disturbers</hi> of the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> and such like Monsters of Nature; and which of all these Crimes does he stand guilty of? Of <hi>Treason</hi> no, for he expresly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, all that Honour, Homage, and Tribute should be render'd to <hi>Caesar,</hi> which is due to <hi>Caesar;</hi> Mat. 22.21. <hi>red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite ergo quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari.</hi> Of breaking the Peace? Ha! no, no, for he is the very God of Peace, <hi>Deus Pacis,</hi> he sent his Disciples about the World as Messengers of Peace, and commanded, that into what House soever they entred, they should not fail to cry, <hi>Pax huic domni,</hi> Peace be to this House. Of <hi>Theft</hi> or <hi>Robbery?</hi> no, no, for he came down from Heaven upon Earth, and left the High, Throne of his Glory, to inrich us Mortals with hsi Poverty, <hi>ut illius inopia nos divites essemus;</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9. Why then <hi>Pilate,</hi> O why dost thou pronounce such a barbarous Sentence against this Innocent? a Sentence so contrary to the Dictates of thy own Conscience? <hi>Go, go,</hi> 'tis cruel, 'tis unut, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since there is no hopes of Justice upon Earth, I appeal to Heaven: But why should I appeal? since he he himself doe not appeal, but submits to this Sentence of Man as to the Sentence of God pronouc't against him for the Sins of his People, <hi>propter scelus populi mei, pecussi eum.</hi> But this is not all, for not content to have lost his Liberty in the hands
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29834:17"/> of <hi>Traytors,</hi> and his honour in the hands of <hi>judges,</hi> he is going now to loose his Blood in the hands of <hi>Bloody Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, whil\st they are binding up the Rods, and preparing the Scourges, the Loving Saviour of the World presents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Spirit before his Heavenly Father, who is arm'd with the Rods and Scourges of his Justice against the Sins of the People; but he (like a tender Mother, who steps between her offended Husband and her guilty Son, choosing to receive the blows herself, and save, her Child) he, <hi>I say,</hi> steps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>his Father's Anger and our Soul's danger,</hi> and makes, as 'twere, a Shield of his own spotless Body, to receive all those heavy stroaks of anger our sins deserv'd, crying by the mouth of the Prophet, <hi>Ego in flagella paratus sum,</hi> Psal. 37. v. 18. O my Eternal Father! there's not a part in this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which you have given me, but what is now prepar'd for Scourges: O turn then, turn away the stripes of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation from the sinful Sons of Men, and turn them all upon the Shoulders of your Innocent Son; for I am ready to go, not only into this <hi>Praetorium,</hi> but to surround the whole World with a Cord about my Neck, and crouds of Totmentors at my Heels, to be scourg'd in all those places where you have been offended: <hi>Ego in flagella paratus sum.</hi> And truely this Mistery was to dolerous, and so ignominious to the Son of God, that you would think the Holy Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists were even afraid to Record it, for all they say of it, is only this, <hi>flegellatus est, he was scourg'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis here then, dear <hi>Christians,</hi> 'tis here, if ever, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you to withdraw you Eyes from all other Objects, and fix them upon your Suffering Redeemer in his bloody posture, to which his own Love, and your Crimes have brought him: 'tis here you may read in Characters of Blood, the excess of his Love to you, and the reciprocal
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29834:18"/> Obligation of your Love to him, for every wound he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at this Pillar, is a Tongue that cries, <hi>Ecce quomodo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,</hi> see, see how he lov'd: And therefore, not to love such a Suffering Love as this, were altogether unsufferable: But why must they needs scourge him in a publick Hall? why do no they rather lead him into some private place, in some measure, at least, to lessen this shameful confusion? When a guilty Criminal is to be scourg'd, it suffices that two or three Witnesses be present; and must all the World be present at the scourging of a God? O why all this pain? why all this shame? why all this rigour? Ha! Sinner, Sinner, 'tis to let thee see thy Crimes are too great to colt thy God but a little; 'tis to let thee know how execrable thole sinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are, for which a God, a God must be scourged: In fine, they strip't him, or (as others have it) they caus'd him to strip himself; and this I may say was, if not the most dolorous, at least, the most ignominious of all his Sufferings; for this indeed is the greatest affront that can be offered to a Man of Honour. That Golden Oracle of theChurch St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> speaking of the three Children in the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> tells us, those scorching flames, forgetful of their own all devouring Nature, touched not the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of these Holy Servants of God, out of a reverential regard to their Honour, and a deep respect to their Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; <hi>Vestibus puerorum ob honestatem ignis pepercit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alas, alas! this Virginal Body, of the spotless Lamb, fram'd of the purest Virgin Blood, by the wonderful Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, or misterious overshadowings of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. must have no such Priviledge, but stands there naked, in this shameful posture expos'd to the publick view of Heaven and Earth, Men and Angels, Friends and Foes. And how methinks, I see the Eyes of these cruel. Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29834:18"/> sparkling with anger, their mouths even foaming with rage, their hands loaden with scourges, and their arms lifted up, ready to begin the woful Tragedy: but hold your hands a while, let's see if there be no hopes of a <hi>Reprieve.</hi> Q Eternal Father, 'tis in your power alone to hear my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and grant my just Request, he's your Only Son, he's the Object of your tender Love, he's Innocent: 'tis true, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Heavenly Father, he's my Son, but he's your Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he's the object of my Love, but thy sin is the object of my hatred; he's Innocent, but thou art a Criminal, strike him then Tormentors, and strike him till he smarts <hi>for the sins of my People; propter scelus populi mei, percutite eam.</hi> Ha! scarce had they struck the second blow, but out springs the <hi>precious Gore</hi> in great abundance, some sprinkles the Walls of the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> some spurts in the very faces of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, and the rest runs trickling down to the around in streams. O my God! my God! what? angry still? Is not your Justice fully satisfied? O sure, <hi>sure</hi> 'tis enough, once more then <hi>Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.</hi> 'Tis true, replies the Heavenly Father, here again; 'tis enough indeed, nay, and too much for him, but not too much for thee, not too much for thy Crimes, thy Rebellions, thy Ingratitudes; strike on again then Tormentors, strike on again for the sins of my People; <hi>propter scelus populi mei percutite eum.</hi> In effect, they struck on with such inhumane Cruelty, and such bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Severity, that at last, his wounds amounted to the number of above five thousand. Ha! <hi>Christians, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> remember this, above five thousand wounds upon the bleeding Body of a <hi>Jesus,</hi> and not one of all these wounds able to wound these flinty Souls of ours? O <hi>Adamantine Hearts!</hi> O Rocks, harder than those that flew to pieces at it. The Royal <hi>Psalmist</hi> seem'd in his Prophetic views, to eye this dolorous Mistery, when in the name of our scourg'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29834:19"/>
                  <hi>Messias,</hi> he broke into this sad Complaint, <hi>supra dorsum meum arraverunt peccatores;</hi> the wicked have not only scourg'd, but even plow'd up my shoulders with their Crimes. And the Learned St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us here, at this Pillar they seem'd to wreck and torment, not so much the parts, as the very wounds of his Body, <hi>torquebant in excessum, non membra, sed ipsa vulnera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O the bloody! O the dolourous! O the Ignominious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom of a loving <hi>Jesus!</hi> his very Tormentors themselves are weary, and the whole Assembly (as hard hearted as they are) crie out aloud, <hi>satis est,</hi> 'tis enough; so at last they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind the Cords, and loose the bleeding <hi>Captive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here, methinks I see him sink and fall, not so much under the weight of these Rods and Scourges, as under the Heavy load of our Iniquities; but having breath'd a while, and coming, as it, were, a little to himself, he seems to wade through a Sea of Blood, to the rocky shore of our hearts, and there groans out this mournful Epostulation: O sinful Sou, for whose dear sake I suffer, see all these bleeding wounds, these wounds upon my Head, these wounds upon my Arms, these wounds, upon my Breast, these wounds vpon, my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, view them all, and view them well, let not so much as one escape thy sight; these I receiv'd for thy Pride, those for thy Vanity, these for thy Intemperance, those for thy sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, and all for thy Crimes, then lay thy hand upon thy heart, and tell me truely, since I have suffered all these wounds for thee, does not this deserve a mutual return of love from thee? but if thou hast found out any darling Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more worthy of thy love than they <hi>wounded Creator;</hi> if thou canst not love me, as least pity me; <hi>misermini mei, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seremini mei saltem vos amiti mei;</hi> Have mercy on me, have mercy on me, at least, you my Friends, you my Priests, you that sacrifice this Body upon Holy Altars; at least, you <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi>

               <p>Ha! Sinner, 'tis thy God that speakes to the ear of thy heart, what answer dost thou return to his Voice, to his Wounds, to his Blood? <hi>Quid vobis videtur de Christo?</hi> What do you think of this Christ, thus rent and torn, and struck for the sins of his people? <hi>Ecce homo,</hi> behold the Man, cry'd <hi>Pilate</hi> to the <hi>Jews;</hi> and <hi>behold the Man,</hi> say I to you <hi>Christians;</hi> for he's expos'd (as this day) every year upon our Altars, to see how your hearts stand affected towards him.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29834:25"/> tears in their Eyes, and perhaps with sorrow in their Hearts, to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize the doleful Obsequies of the World's <hi>Messias:</hi> but alas! alas! scarce is the Son of God intomb'd, scarce is the <hi>great Stone seal'd up close,</hi> but away they go, and leave their <hi>Jesus</hi> all alone; the Ambitions Man returns to his Pomps and Vanities; the Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious Man to his Bags and his Coffers; the Voluptuous Man to his Pleasures and his Pastimes, and all to their old Haunts, to their old Habits and vitious Practices, <hi>rursum crucifigentes Filium Dei.</hi>

               <p>But you, for your parts, most pious Auditors, and dear <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> if the Beloved of your Souls is so ill treated by the major part of ungrateful Mortals, let him find a kinder entertainment at your hands; if they trample the Blood of the <hi>Lamb</hi> under foot, do you preserve it as a precious Relick in the holy Shrines of your Hearts; if they dayly wound him anew, and make him bleed afresh by Sin, do you bathe these wounds with the dayly tears of Repeptance, and stop his Blood With the ardent fires and flames of loving Heart: In a word; if you love your wounded <hi>Jesus,</hi> (as I hope you do) think of nothing but these Wounds, speak of nothing but these Wounds; if you read, let it be of these Wounds; if you write, let it be of these Wounds; if you eat, dip every morsel In these Wounds; nay, if you sleep, dream of these Wounds; and when you awake breath the first acts of your Hearts into these Wounds; in all your Afflictions and Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations fly for Refuge to these Wounds; and to conclude, live, live and die in these Wounds of the Crucifi'd <hi>Jesus;</hi> where now I leave you, for in a better place, I am sure I cannot leave you. <hi>Amen.</hi>
